# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Dataset
Iris Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Task Description
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand data distribution,
feature relationships, outliers, and important predictors.

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Histogram analysis
- Count plot for categorical feature
- Box plot for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance identification
- Final summary of insights

## Key Insights
- Dataset contains 150 samples with no missing values.
- Dataset is balanced across all species.
- Petal length and petal width show strong positive correlation.
- Sepal width contains minor outliers.
- Petal features are most important for prediction.

## Conclusion
EDA helped in understanding data patterns and identifying
important features for machine learning modeling.
